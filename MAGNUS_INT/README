This Dockerfile uses the Docker image made by Mohsin Shaikh from Pawsey
to create an environment that has anaconda installed along with the proper 
version of MPI (MPICH/3.2.1) that can be used on Magnus. This Dockerfile 
adds all the dependencies required to run the orbital integration code 
written in Python3.
